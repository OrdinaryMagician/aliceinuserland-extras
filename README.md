# Alice in Userland (extras)

A collection of additional tools from the Alice in Userland project. Meant to be an extension.

Pretty much all the components of this package are detached/simplified parts of the normal coreutils.

These utils have even more extra spice than the core ones, and, being just extras, don't comply to any standards at all.
