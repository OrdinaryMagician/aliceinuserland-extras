This is a list of all the possible utils I can think of. I'll be filling it up every once in a while.

say - prints all the arguments one after another, terminated with a newline. Absolutely no options or special handling, just printing.
desc - resolves backspace escapes from stdin to stdout.
esc - escapes non-printable characters and characters with known escapes from stdin to stdout.
esca - escapes ALL characters (as octal backslash escapes) from stdin to stdout.
spipe - read from stdin, write to stdout. handle all possible errors in I/O operations.
tpipe - tight pipe. takes one argument as the speed in bytes/second I/O should be done, also does the same checks as spipe.
meter - measures read and write speeds (output is sent to stderr), prints the averages and amount of data sent when input or output stops.
pbar - progress bar, expects one argument, the size in bytes for the transfer.
del - idiot-proof alternative to rm. asks for confirmation, and tells you what it's going to delete before asking. Important deletions require you to write "Yes" instead of just "y".
itob - reads a list of integers from stdin and prints the values in bytes (as bytes, not a text representation) to stdout. this is actually useful.
btxt - reads from stdin and sends to stdout the hex values for each character as a seamless stream. similar to the behavior of od with certain options.
spam - similar to yes, but excludes newlines. useful for quick filling of devices with a special pattern or something.
asleep - absolute sleep. sleeps until a specific date. it just exits immediately if the date is in the past. can't travel back in time, y'know.
